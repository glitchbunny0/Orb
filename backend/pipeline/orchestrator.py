"""
orchestrator.py — Sequences the three passes for one turn.

:func:`_run_pipeline` resolves the per-turn config, threads a mutable
:class:`TurnState` through the director, writer, and editor stages, runs
POST_PIPELINE workflow hooks, and emits the terminal ``_result`` event.

Context loading lives in ``context``, persistence in ``persistence``, and the
public entry points in ``entrypoints``. ``_run_pipeline`` is called by
``_generate_reply`` (and directly by tests).
