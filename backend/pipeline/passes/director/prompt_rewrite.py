"""
passes/director/prompt_rewrite.py — The user-prompt-rewrite feature.

Rewrites a vague user message into a fuller prompt before the writer runs, via
the ``rewrite_user_prompt`` tool. The director runs it first (see
:func:`order_director_tools`) so a user can stop before the full director runs
if they don't like the result; its reasoning is suppressed because the rephrase
is mechanical and adds latency.

The tool schema stays in ``tool_registry.py`` (part of the cached tool blob;
moving it would bust the KV cache). The instruction template lives in
``prompt_builder.py``. Only the Python glue lives here — matching the pattern in
``length_guard.py``.
